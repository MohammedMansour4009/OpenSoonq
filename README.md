# Application Description

The application is designed to streamline the management and display of data related to categories, subcategories, and options. It incorporates optimization techniques to enhance performance and user experience.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Data Storage**: Upon the initial launch of the application, data from categories, subcategories, and options is retrieved and stored locally. This eliminates the need for frequent database queries, as the data is readily available for subsequent use.

- **Improved Performance**: By storing the data on the first screen, the application significantly reduces the time and resources required to retrieve options from the database. This results in faster load times and a smoother user experience.

- **Canonical URL Integration**: The application integrates a canonical URL, which is configured in the `gradle.properties` file. This URL serves as a convenient link that allows users to effortlessly access and view associated images related to the data.
